        "body": "This pr represents a _bold_ and forward thinking step towards modernizing the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration, I have deleted the entirety of the existing, obsolete Linux source code and replaced it with `HelloWorld.java` file. This is the beginning of a truly enterprise™️-ready rewrite of Linux, utilizing the _unparalleled_ robustness of Java©️™️.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Deleted every single file.\r\n\r\n- Added one (1) enterprise™️-ready file: HelloWorld.java:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class HelloWorld {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Why Java©️™️?\r\n\r\nJava©️™️ brings a plethora of benefits to the Linux kernel:\r\n\r\n### Enterprise Readiness:\r\n\r\nThe JVM©️™️ (Java©️™️ Virtual Machine) is practically synonymous with enterprise™️ and business©️.\r\n\r\n### Memory Management:\r\n\r\nGarbage collection!!!\r\n\r\n### Security:\r\n\r\nWith Java©️™️’s sandboxing features, the kernel is now immune to null-pointer dereferences. (You're welcome.)\r\n\r\n### Cross-Platform:\r\n\r\nNow the linux kernel can run on the JVM©️™️! over 3(?) billion devices run java, meaning Linux will skyrocket in popularity!\r\n\r\n### Better Syntax:\r\n\r\n`System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\")` is infinitely more intuitive than `printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\")`;.\r\n\r\n### Zero Buffer Overflows:\r\n\r\nBecause strings are objects now.\r\n\r\n### Future Plans\r\n\r\nThis pull request is just the beginning of an exciting journey. Future enhancements will include:\r\n\r\n- `AbstractKernelFactory.java` for creating kernel abstractions.\r\n- `AbstractKernelFactoryFactory.java` for creating those kernel abstraction factories.\r\n- `SingletonKernel.java` to ensure only one kernel instance per JVM.\r\n- Microservices Architecture to replace monolithic processes.\r\n- Integration with industry-standard tools like Spring Boot.\r\n\r\n### Advantages Over C\r\n\r\n- More enterprise™️\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTesting was performed rigorously by running `java HelloWorld.java` All tests passed.\r\n\r\n### Potential Issues\r\n\r\n- JVM startup time *might* slightly increase kernel boot times (initial estimates: 12 minutes per core). \r\n\r\n- *Minor* backward compatibility concerns (The whole project has been deleted).\r\n\r\n### Request for Comments\r\n\r\nLet’s move Linux forward into the brave world of enterprise™️™️™️-grade software. Please provide feedback, but only if it aligns with the principles of Java©️™️. Constructive criticism will be filed in /dev/null. I will discuss it with my team in the next Agile Sprint Standup Poker!"

The function chip_ready() return OK status while the actual writing or erasing is not finished on NOR flash device. It leads to I/O error and fail in writing, erasing or verifying of the data during working with MTD devices.\r\n\r\nWhen the issue with writing is reproduced we compared the data of LinuxKERNEL.img and the data which was written on the /dev/mtdX device:\r\ndd if=/dev/mtd3 bs=2367008 count=1 > /persistent/dest.buf\r\nhexdump /persistent/dest.buf > /persistent/dest.hex\r\nhexdump /persistent/LinuxKERNEL.img > /persistent/source.hex\r\ndiff -purN /persistent/dest.hex /persistent/source.hex\r\n\r\nAnd it was observed that the driver didn't write some blocks at all (0xffff instead of real data in some places). Flash driver skip writing or hasn't been finished it during the specific time.\r\n\r\nI found that in Internet I am not alone in this world, but I didn't find some solution for this problem which doesn't lead to increasing of the time of writing.  So I investigate the writing and found that there is no any check that the data is really was written on the Flash. So the proposed solution is to compare the given last byte with written one. We have run a long stubility during several weeks on our side with Switch Board using writing on NOR flash and the problem is not reproduced.\r\n# FREQUENCY:\r\n\r\n1%\r\nThe I/O error appears about 1 time during 3-4 hours writing on NOR flash. But it was not possible to determine exactly at what time the issue can happen.\r\n# SYSTEM IMPACT:\r\n\r\nfails to write/erase on NOR flash\r\n# FIX DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nWait until the following checks return positive results during writing/erasing on NOR Flash:\r\n1. read the data/status from the device (checking status of the NOR Flash: busy, timeout or ok(data)) return ok;\r\n2. check the last byte of given buffer data is written in case of WRITE or the last map word is erased in case of ERASE.\r\n# TEST DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nStart writing some data on NOR FLASH (mtd device) using flashcp or start erasing using flash_erase.\r\n"
